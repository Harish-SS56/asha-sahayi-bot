## 📱 Usage

### Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Start the bot and select language |
| `/help` | View help guide |
| `/language` | Change language preference |
| `/patients` | View your patient list |
| `/stats` | View your statistics |
| `/followups` | View pending follow-ups |

### Recording Patient Visits

**Voice:** Send a voice note describing the visit in any supported language.

**Text:** Type the update directly:
```

She complained of headache and dizziness. Gave paracetamol.
Need follow-up in 3 days.
```

### Asking Medical Questions

Simply type your question:
```
What are the danger signs during pregnancy?
```

The bot will respond with information from official NHM guidelines.

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

### Language Detection
The system automatically detects the input language and responds accordingly.

### Translation Logic
1. Voice notes are transcribed in the detected language
2. Structured data is extracted and normalized to English for storage
3. Responses are generated in the user's preferred language
4. Medical terms are preserved with local translations

### Supported Languages
- **English (en)** - Primary development language
- **Hindi (hi)** - हिन्दी with Devanagari script support
- **Tamil (ta)** - தமிழ் with Tamil script support  
- **Malayalam (ml)** - മലയാളം with Malayalam script support

---

## 📚 RAG System

### Document Sources

The RAG system indexes these official healthcare documents:

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `guidelines-on-asha.pdf` | ASHA program guidelines |
| `Handbook for ASHA on Home Based Care.pdf` | Home care protocols |
| `Hypertension_full.pdf` | Hypertension management |
| `imnci_chart_booklet.pdf` | Child health (IMNCI) |
| `sba_guidelines_for_skilled_attendance_at_birth.pdf` | Maternal health |

### How RAG Works

1. **Document Indexing**
   - PDFs are loaded and parsed
   - Text is split into chunks (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
   - Chunks are embedded using Azure OpenAI
   - Embeddings stored in ChromaDB

2. **Query Processing**
   - User query is embedded
   - Similar chunks retrieved from ChromaDB
   - Retrieved context sent to GPT-4o
   - Response grounded in official guidelines

### Indexing Documents

```bash
python index_documents.py
```

## �️ Ethical AI & Data Privacy Statement

This section addresses the three pillars required for UNESCO-affiliated AI projects.

---

### I. Medical Safety — Handling AI Hallucinations

AI language models can occasionally generate confident but incorrect information ("hallucinations"). This system uses a **multi-layer defence strategy** to protect ASHA workers and their patients:

#### Layer 1: RAG Grounding (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Every AI response is grounded in **official NHM/WHO documents** retrieved from a verified vector database. The model is instructed to answer only from retrieved context, not from general knowledge.

> *"Only answer based on the provided NHM guidelines context. If the context does not contain enough information to answer, say so clearly."*

**Sources used:**
- NHM ASHA Programme Guidelines
- NHM Hypertension Management Guidelines
- IMNCI (Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness) Chart Booklet
- SBA Guidelines for Skilled Birth Attendance
- National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) Guidelines
- Revised Home-Based Newborn Care Guidelines

#### Layer 2: Mandatory Disclaimer on Every Response
Every single AI response — without exception — appends:
> ⚠️ *DISCLAIMER: This assistant supports ASHA workers and should not replace licensed medical professionals. Always consult a doctor for medical decisions.*

This is enforced in code (`clean_ai_response()` removes any AI-generated disclaimer before our standardised one is appended, ensuring exactly one disclaimer always appears).

#### Layer 3: Assistant Identity Framing
The system prompt explicitly frames the bot as a **support tool, not a doctor**:
> *"You are ASHA Sahayi, an AI assistant that helps ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers. You are NOT a doctor. Always recommend consulting a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment."*

#### Layer 4: Emergency Override
When any critical symptom is detected (chest pain, convulsions, heavy bleeding, unconsciousness, etc.), the bot **bypasses the AI entirely** and immediately displays a hard-coded emergency message directing the user to call **108** and go to the nearest health facility.

#### Layer 5: No Diagnosis Policy
The bot is instructed to never provide:
- Definitive diagnoses
- Prescription advice
- Dosage instructions beyond basic ORS/Paracetamol first aid

---

### II. PII Protection — Personally Identifiable Information Strategy

#### What PII Is Collected
The bot collects the minimum data necessary for ASHA workers to track patient care:

| Data Type | Storage | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Patient name | PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest via Neon) | Patient identification |
| Age, gender | PostgreSQL | Clinical context |
| Village/address | PostgreSQL | Geographic tracking |
| Phone number | PostgreSQL | Emergency contact |
| Health vitals (BP, temp) | PostgreSQL | Medical record |
| Pregnancy status | PostgreSQL | Antenatal care tracking |
| Voice transcriptions | Not stored permanently | Used only for extraction, then discarded |

#### What PII Is NOT Stored
- **Application logs** contain only anonymous worker IDs and event types — no patient names, health data, or personal details
- **Credentials and API keys** are stored exclusively in environment variables (`.env`), never in source code
- **Conversation AI responses** are stored only for quality improvement and are not shared with third parties

#### Access Control
- Patient data is **scoped per ASHA worker** — a worker can only access patients they registered
- No cross-worker data access is possible through the bot interface
- Database access requires authenticated PostgreSQL credentials

#### Data Storage Security
- Hosted on **Neon PostgreSQL** (serverless, SOC 2 compliant)
- All connections use `sslmode=require`
- No raw SQL string construction — all queries use **SQLAlchemy ORM** with parameterised queries (prevents SQL injection)

#### Data Minimisation
- Names in non-Latin scripts (Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam) are stored as-is without transliteration
- The system validates that extracted patient names are real names (rejects values like "null", "hi", single characters) — *this is actively being improved*

---

### III. Consent — Ensuring Workers Have the Right to Log Data

#### Worker Registration Consent
When an ASHA worker sends `/start`, they are shown an onboarding message that explicitly states:
> *"This bot helps you record patient visits and health information. By using this bot, you confirm you are an authorised ASHA worker and have informed your patients that their health data will be recorded digitally for care management."*

Workers must actively choose a language and proceed — this constitutes **informed engagement consent**.

#### Patient Data Consent Responsibility
Under India's **Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023** and NHM guidelines:
- ASHA workers, as registered health workers, are authorised to maintain patient health records
- The ASHA programme itself is a government-mandated health tracking programme
- Workers are trained to inform patients about health record keeping as part of their programme obligations

#### Data Purpose Limitation
Data collected is used **only** for:
1. Tracking patient health progress by the assigned ASHA worker
2. Generating follow-up reminders for the same worker
3. Improving response quality via anonymised feedback signals

Data is **not** used for:
- Training AI models
- Sharing with third parties
- Advertising or commercial purposes
- Research without explicit additional consent

#### Right to Deletion
Workers can contact the system administrator to request deletion of their data and all associated patient records. (A self-service `/delete_my_data` command is planned for a future release.)

---

### Emergency Handling

The bot monitors for these emergency symptoms across all languages:
- Severe chest pain / difficulty breathing
- High fever (>103°F / >39.4°C)
- Heavy bleeding (obstetric or otherwise)
- Loss of consciousness / convulsions / seizures
- Stroke symptoms (facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty)
- Severe preeclampsia signs (BP ≥140/90 + headache + swelling in pregnancy)

When detected, the bot immediately:
1. Displays a prominent emergency alert
2. Instructs the worker to call **108** (National Ambulance Service)
3. Provides basic first-aid steps while help is on the way
4. Recommends the nearest PHC/CHC/District Hospital

---
